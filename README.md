# Data-structure-and-Algorithms

Some very important data structures and algorithms for database systems, involving __indexing and hashing__, __query processing__ and __query optimization__.

Implementing them using C++ in a very simplified mode. However, there're a very complicated schema in real DBMS.

##1. Basic data structures

* Left-leaning red-black tree: A in-memory red-black tree, left-leaning model using recursive insertion mode, which is introduced in _Algorithms Fourth Edition_ by _Robert Sedgewick_ and _Kevin Wayne_.

* B Tree: A simple B tree data structure, witch is barely used in real DBMS. It is worth noting about its insertion and deletion algorithms.

* B+ Tree: A complete implementation of B+ tree demon, trying to simulate an ordered, dense indexing schema.

* Dynamic hash table: Dynamic hash structure.
