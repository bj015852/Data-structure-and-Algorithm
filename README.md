# Data-structure-and-Algorithms

Some very important data structures and algorithms for database systems, involving __indexing and hashing__, __query processing__ and __query optimization__.

Implement them using C++ in a very simplified mode. However, there're a very complicated schema in real DBMS.

##1. Basic data structures

* Left-leaning red-black tree: A in-memory red-black tree, left-leaning model using recursive method for insertion.

* B Tree: A simple B tree data structure, witch is barely used in real DBMS.

* B+ Tree: B+ tree data structure trying to simulate an ordered indexing shcema.

* Dynamic hash table: Dynamic hash structure.
