# Data-structure-and-Algorithm

Some very important data structures and algorithms for database systems, involving __indexing and hashing__, __query processing__ and __query optimization__.

1. Basic data structure

  * Left-leaning red-black tree: A in-memory red-black tree, left-leaning model using recursive method for insertion.

  * B Tree: A simple B tree data structure, witch is barely used in real DBMS.

  * B+ Tree: B+ tree data structure trying to simulate an ordered indexing shcema.

  * Dynamic hash table: Dynamic hash structure.
